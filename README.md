# [Responsive-Portfolio](https://ariehh1.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/)

For my second [repository](https://github.com/ariehh1/Responsive-Portfolio) on Github, I have created a Responsive Portfolio.  This specific portfolio details the second version of my original portfolio (Ari-Horowitz-About-Me).  I'm layering in the fundamental concepts of Bootstrap to allow for a responsive website and mobile application.  As an early developer in the industry, I'm learning how critical a mobile first application really is.  The same page elements of an Index, Portfolio, and Contact Me hold true in this portfolio as well.

In creating this portfolio, it made me think about how stationary my previous portfolio ultimately was.  Collapsing the width of the website page and inserting a dynamic navbar in the top right portion are certainly example elements that make this version stand out.  For this portfolio, I took full advantage of the Bootstrap documentation materials, w3schools.com, and YouTube tutorials to round out my understanding.

As a future web developer, I look forward to utilizing Bootstrap and spend less time on all of the CSS properties.  I definitely understand how time consuming the CSS properties take when adding those into a particular resource (changing the pixel width of an image).  When adding in Bootstrap, the pre-determined aesthetics are immediately implemented with that specific code.  My time will now be spent testing new Bootstrap features and seeing if those suit the makeup of my portfolio.
